// This is Sudoku Solver (Inefficient) - Demo Version
// The Demo version has a very bare-bones user interface.
// The Demo version has extra features and is intended for demonstrations, rather than actual customization or tinkering.
// It is much easier to modify or customize Sudoku Solver - Hack Version.
//
// This is a backtracking recursive sudoku solver written in C.
// The final outcome of the solve(Sudoku p) method is as follows:
//      1) If the given sudoku is solvable:
//          - Returns an int representing the number of solutions for the given puzzle
//          - Prints out all possible solutions
//      2) If the given sudoku is NOT solvable:
//          - Returns the int 0, as there are zero possible solutions for the given puzzle
//          - Does NOT print anything, unless it is instructed to after the solve(Sudoku p) method is call
//
