// This is Sudoku Solver (Inefficient) - Hack Version.
// The Hack version does not have a user interface.
// The Hack version is meant for customization and tinkering, and does not have any of the extra features included in the Demo version.
// The Hack version is only able to solve one sudoku per excecution, making the excecution time representative of the time needed to solve a given sudoku.
// It is much easier to demonstrate the algorithm using Sudoku Solver - Demo Version.

//
// This is a backtracking recursive sudoku solver written in C.
// The final outcome of the solve(Sudoku p) method is as follows:
//      1) If the given sudoku is solvable:
//          - Returns an int representing the number of solutions for the given puzzle
//          - Prints out all possible solutions
//      2) If the given sudoku is NOT solvable:
//          - Returns the int 0, as there are zero possible solutions for the given puzzle
//          - Does NOT print anything, unless it is instructed to after the solve(Sudoku p) method is call
//
